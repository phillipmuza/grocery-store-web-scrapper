# Grocery Store Web Crawler

This project is a web crawler designed to extract links from various grocery stores. It uses Python with the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to navigate and extract links from web pages. The crawler is designed to be modular, allowing for easy addition of new grocery stores and new types of links to extract.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily add new grocery stores and types of links to extract.
- **Logging**: Logs the status of the crawler and any errors encountered.
- **Output**: Saves the extracted links to a file for easy analysis.

## Getting Started

- NEED TO ADD the section on how to run the code
- Possibly as a docker container as a lot of the dependencies are python based
